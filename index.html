                    Hi! I'm Eric and I'm a recent new-grad Computer Science and Statistics Major from 
                    University of California, Berkeley. I have had a summer research internship in the 
                    past where I worked on two research papers for publishing, as well as two software 
                    development internships at Qualtrics and Amazon where I gained valuable experience 
                    working on mainly back-end services. As for technical skills, I am most fluent in Java 
                    and Python and am experienced with C, Javascript, and others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am most interested in full-stack development, since I love the feeling 
                    of achievement seeing an application or tool brought to life, but am keen to learn 
                    any new skills and technologies in other areas of development
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I love playing badminton, 
                    climbing, playing games, and playing the violin or guitar. I look forward to connecting 
                    with you!
                </p>

                <!-- <p>
                    Hello! Nice to meet you! I'm currently an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Computer
                    Science and Statistics. I am interested in working on projects that explore the interdisciplinary
                    applications of sofware development. </br> </br>
                    I am currently searching for an full-time software engineering role after graduating in May 2023, so if you are interested
                    in working with me, feel free to <a href="mailto:e_chang1@berkeley.edu" class="link">contact me!</a>
                    Some of the courses I have taken include 
                    <a href="https://cs61a.org/" class="link">CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>,
                    <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/" class="link">CS 61B: Data Structures</a>,
                    <a href="https://cs61c.org/fa20/" class="link">CS 61C: Machine Structures</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.eecs70.org/" class="link">CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory</a>,
                    <a href="https://cs170.org/" class="link">CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems</a>,
                    <a href="https://cs161.org/" class="link">CS 161: Computer Security</a>,
                    and <a href="https://cs186berkeley.net/" class="link">CS 186: Introduction to Database Systems</a>.
                    My favorite course so far has been CS 61B, and is why I have helped teach the content to other aspiring developers through
                    being an academic intern as well as a mentor for the course.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relevant coursework I am currently enrolled in include
                    <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS162/" class="link">CS 162: Operating Systems and System Programming</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I love playing badminton, watching 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3PIy21qgak" class="link">cardistry</a> videos on YouTube,
                    and listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/omnom1?si=z8BlBR-nRbKfoTlN6mcJuw" class = "link">music</a>.
